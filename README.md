GTFS Builder | XLS Tools for Google Transit

A bit of history
This is an updated version of the tools created by Bob Heitzman and maintained mostly ever since by Marcy Jaffe. You can read more about the code's history on Bob's website at https://sites.google.com/site/rheitzman/. Since then, the XLS Tools for Google Transit was mostly repackaged by the National Rural Transit Assistance Program (RTAP) and rebranded as GTFSBuilder.

After testing the tools with some local transport agencies in Qu√©bec, I discovered some flaws with UTF-8 encoding (required by the GTFS standard) and some other little irritations. So I updated the tools to be able to use it with accented characters.

I contacted Bob Heitzman and Marcy Jaffe to suggest them to have a single repository where it would be easier for everyone to contribute and have an historic of the code modifications. Bob granted me the rights (it was already in public domain). So here are the tools, starting with the previous available version and then updated to the modified version I made.

Contributing
Anyone is free to use, fork, modify and contribute back to the tools.
